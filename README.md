Scansion of Latin Dactylic Hexameter with Manual Adjustment

Website with Explanation: https://sydliuu.github.io/Lady-Lius-Latin/



A Java program that scans Latin dactylic hexameter poetry, and a website coded from HTML + CSS explaining how it works. 

Dactylic hexameter is a poetic meter used in classical epics such as Vergil's Aeneid. My program determines the quantity [long (-) or short (U)] of each vowel sound in a line of Latin dactylic hexameter without access to a dictionary or data sets. Instead, it uses constraint satisfaction in a combination of Latin rules and meter constraints. This mirrors the process that Latin students would do by hand. 

Since this process is not failsafe due unique exceptions and poetic license, the manual adjustment feature allows the program to be robust. The user is able to override program assumptions or input additional information, and the line gets rescanned with these new constraints in mind.
