    <h3 class = "subhead">As a Latin student, I found scanning dactylic hexameter poetry to be tedious.</h3>
    <p>Inspired, I decided to code a program that would do it for me, using the process that I normally did by hand. The result is this Java project that I coded in the summer after my sophomore year of high school, during the summer of the 2020 Covid pandemic.</p>
    <p>In 2022, I coded this website in HTML + CSS.</p><br>

    <h2>About Dactylic Hexameter</h2>
    <p> <strong>Dactylic hexameter</strong> is a <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/poetry-101-what-is-meter-learn-the-difference-between-qualitative-and-quantitative-meter-in-poetry-with-examples">poetic meter</a>, largely used in classical Latin or Greek epic poems such as Vergil's <em>Aeneid</em>.</p>
    <p>A large part of scanning dactylic hexameter involves determining the "quantity" of each vowel sound in the line. Each vowel sound is marked as either long (-) or short (U) based on a set of specific rules.
    <p>This is somewhat similar to scanning Shakespeare's <em>iambic pentameter</em>, in which syllables are marked stressed or unstressed. Note, however, that dactylic hexameter is a <em>quantitative meter</em> (based on syllable length) whereas iambic pentameter is a <em>qualitative meter</em> (based on syllable stress).</p></p>

    <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
    <p class ="statement">Scanning a line of Latin dactylic hexameter without access to a dictionary or datasets.</p>
  </section>

  <section class= "white", id="projPurpose">
    <h2>The user inputs a line of Latin dactylic hexameter.<br>The program will scan it, using the following process...</h2>
    <p><strong>The program first marks the quantities it can determine without using meter rules.</strong> This is the first pass of the line. The program decides what is considered vowel sounds. Then, it takes into account longs by position and longs by nature to mark vowel sounds as long (-) if possible. Vowel sounds that are elided or prodelided (silenced) are marked with ('). The remaining vowel sounds are left as unknown (?).</p>

    <p><strong>Then, the program applies meter constraints to fill in the rest of the unknown quantities.</strong> It's basic constraint satisfaction. We certain quantities are long, based on step one. We also know that the line has to fulfill meter constraints: the line can only consist of dactyls (-UU) and spondees (- -), and there's six feet per line. We also know that the penultimate foot is commonly a dactyl. This is the second pass of the line. Building off the knowns in step one, then applying meter constraints, the program can fill in the rest of the unknown quantities rather accurately.</p>

    <p><strong>While this method is quite effective, however, it is not 100% accurate</strong>... </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes, not enough information can be deduced based on vowel length rules and meter constraints alone. This is just the nature of the line, and the program is forced to guess. In that case, extra information can be manually provided. You can, for example, consult a dictionary to find out a vowel length based on vocabulary, change the unknown quantity (?) into long(—) or short(U), and the line will be rescanned with this new information.</li>
        <li>The program may also make incorrect assumptions in step one... For example, if the poet intentionally chooses to disobey elision rules (<em>hiatus</em>), if 'i' is not treated as a vowel, but a consonant (it's like a 'j', e.g. "adiectus"), or if there's a word with adjacent vowels that look like a diphthong but isn't (e.g. in "deus", eu is not a diphthong). You can override the program's assumptions using the OVERRIDE and ADD/REMOVE functions discussed in INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
        <li>See <a href="#pitfallsSec">Pitfalls</a> for more reasons why you may need to use manual adjustment.</li>
      </ul>

    <p><strong>...Which is why the program allows for manual adjustment.</strong> The manual adjustment feature gives users the abilities to override incorrect assumptions, to fill in where the program is forced to guess, and to account for exceptions. With the slight manual adjustment, the program will take in this new information and re-scan the line with this new information in mind.</p>

    <h2>Project Reflections & Problem Solving</h2>
    <h3>Coming Up with the Idea</h3>

    <p>I sat in my honors Latin II class, frustrated, as I scanned yet another line of Latin dactylic hexameter—a painfully slow process for me, who hadn't gotten the intuition for scansion yet. Surely, I thought, there's a way to automate this. I came up with this idea, and pitched it to my Latin teacher, Dr. Salazar, and my computer science teacher, Dr. Ortiz, and had a great time collaborating with professors from such different disciplines.</p>
    <p>At this point, I had very bare-bones coding experience: all I had was AP computer science A. I coded this in Java, using the BlueJ IDE, which was what we had used in my class at the time. I learned a lot from making this project, on both programming and Latin ends, and I'm so glad I did.</p>


    <h3>Program Logic</h3>
    <p>I came up with the idea to make this scansion program on my own, but soon realized that somebody else already did something similar to what I had envisioned. My program originally followed <a href="http://www.logical.ai/arma/">this JavaScript site's logic</a> for the most part; I hadn't looked at the JS code, although I'd later look at the logic explanation.</p>

    <p>Essentially, as previously explained, the program's first pass marks what it can as long without using meter rules (i.e., using long by position and long by nature). In the second pass, we apply meter constraints.  Starting from the back (right to left) since the penultimate foot is almost always a dactyl, the program looks at three quantities at a time. It repeatedly tries to make dactyls, but if the attempt fails (i.e. making a dactyl would contradict with one of the known quantities), it makes a spondee. Once a dactyl can no longer fit in the remaining space within the portion of the line (i.e. there are either two or four spaces left), it makes the rest of the unknown quantities in the portion as long, hence spondees.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Let's first call the last three indexes within the line as a, b, and c respectively.</li>
      <li>If abc can be made into a dactyl, i.e. if a is NOT short and b is NOT long and c is NOT long, then make abc a dactyl and reassign abc where c is to the left of where a was before.</li>
        <ul><li>e.g. ...?????? = ...???abc →  ...???-UU → ...abc-UU</li></ul>
      <li>If, however, either a is short, b is long, or c is short, then abc can't be a dactyl. Thus, make bc into a spondee, and reassign abc where c is where a was.</li>
        <ul><li>e.g. ...????U?? = ...????abc → ...??abc--</li></ul>
      <li>It does this process until it reaches the beginning of the line. It'll make a dactyl if it can, but if it can't, or not enough room is available for a dactyl, it makes a spondee.</li>
        <ul><li>e.g. Two quantities left: ???-... = ?abc... → ??--... (only two ??)→ ----... </li></ul>
        <ul><li>e.g. Four quantities left: ?abc... (can't make a dactyl, else left with one quantity) → ----...</li></ul>

      <li>And this logic worked great... until I added my manual adjustment feature.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Adding the Manual Adjustment Feature</h3>
    <p>I made my code from the JS one different, however, by creating the manual adjustment features (OVERRIDE/ADD/REMOVE functions) since I noticed that the JS program wasn't always so accurate. My program, therefore, unlike the JS one, allows the user to adjust the program assumptions and rescan the line, making my program far more robust. My code can thus account for unusual cases or artistic license, which is necessary for the flexible nature of language and poetry–for which it's hard to code strictly defined rules.</p>

    <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
    <p>I quickly realized, though, that my manual correction addition would force me to modify part of the JS logic. The JS site scans right to left like mine, attempting to make dactyls and making a spondee if it can't—but it does this with the whole line as opposed to finding any known foot breaks first and scanning in chunks. That's fine for the JS site since it's step I will only have longs because it only checks for long by position or nature. In my program, though, since OVERRIDE lets users assign quantities as short (U), I have to find the foot breaks first, or else the short quantity might not align properly, and would be forced into a spondee. Thus, I had to fill in "known by meter"s and find known foot breaks, then do the scanning in chunks.</p>

    <h4>Finding "Known By Meters"</h4>
    <p>If any of these conditions are met, the program will mark the quantities as follows... (underscore _ denotes any quantity, -/U/?)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>-_- → ---</li>
      <li>-_U → -UU</li>
      <li>-U_ → -UU</li>
      <li>__U_U_ → -UU-UU</li>
      <li>__U- → -UU</li>
      <li>_UU → -UU</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>If conditions 4, 5, or 6, it also checks if it triggers conditions 1 or 5, which end in a long, because 4/5/6 fill in a long on the left.</em></p>
      <ul><li>e.g. -??UU (6)→ -?-UU (1)→ -_-UU</li></ul>
    <p><strong>Why might "known by meters" be necessary with the manual adjustment addition?</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>For example, if the first pass has ?-U???​, the second pass should be ?-UU--.​</li>
        <ul>
          <li>With my earlier program, it would first become ?-U-UU since scanning right to left and checking the last three quantities (?-Uabc) would lead the program to believe that it can make abc, ???, into a dactyl.</li>
          <li>When we have ?-U-UU, here, it would be (abc-UU) where abc=?-U is the next three quantities, which cannot be a dactyl... so it would force two of the quantities into a spondee, overwriting the U, giving us ?---UU​.</li>
          <li>My code instead finds "known by meters" to fix this. I know that any instance of -U? must be -UU. So it goes to ?-UU??. From there, it starts the check three quantities process, where U?? is abc. Here, it can't be a dactyl, so ?? becomes a spondee, and we get ?-UU--.​​</li>
        </ul>
      <li><em>But this was not enough!!!​</em></li>
    </ul>



    <h4>Finding footbreaks, and scanning in chunks</h4>
    <p>After filling in the knowns by meter, the program will find footbreaks.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The program first marks a foot break at the very front of the line, and right before the long, anceps at the end (|-X).</li>
      <li>It then determines foot breaks based on known dactyls, putting a foot break before and after each known dactyl, taking care not to repeat foot breaks.</li>
        <ul><li>-UU → |-UU|</li></ul>
      <li>Based on knowing the foot breaks from steps 1 and 2, it then can determine more foot breaks with the following conditions. </li>

        <ol>
          <li>|-- → |--|</li>
          <li>|??U → |??U|</li>
          <li>|?U? → |?U?|</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Note that we only care about marking foot breaks on the right! We don't need to worry about, for example,</em> ( --| → |--|). <em>The program already scans right to left, so it would be redundant to mark leading foot breaks. See step 4.</em></p>

      <li>After the foot breaks are established, the program does process described in <strong>Program Logic</strong> is done in chunks between those foot breaks. For each chunk between foot breaks, the program works right to left, looking at three quantities at a time, and tries to make a dactyl, and makes a spondee if it fails.</li>
    </ol>


    <p><strong>Why might finding footbreaks be necessary with the manual adjustment addition?</strong></p>
    <ul><li>Take, for example, |??U-???|, which should be -UU---- in pass two.​</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If I didn't find "known by meters" first, this would go to  ??U-abc → ?abc-UU → (can't make a dactyl, abc = ?U-) ?---UU.</li>
        <li>But even now that my code finds the "known by meter" ??U-??? → -UU-???, but that isn't enough! ??U-??? → -UU--UU. Bad!!</li>
        <li>Finding known foot breaks solves this problem. -UU-??? → |-UU|-???| → |-UU|----| ta-da!​​</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>This program was coded in Java 8, in the BlueJ IDE. There are two classes: Main and DactHexLine. Main is my driver class that runs the user input. Each line that gets scanned is represented as a DactHexLine object. Every DactHexLine object has several parallel ArrayList instance variables, including ones that hold the indexes of the vowel sounds and another that holds their corresponding quantities. I represented quantities with numbers, where 1 = U, 2 = -, 3 = X and 5 = ?; I arbitrarily used 5 instead of 0 since I represented elided vowels with a negative so that eliding would be easily reversible (e.g. a long vowel that is elided is -2), and -0 would be the same as 0, which is problematic if I have an elided unknown quantity.</p>
    <p>I learned a lot about making code for larger project and the logic process. I especially took with me the importance of psuedocode and documentation. My documentation, although definitely not perfect, helped me edit my code months after not looking at it. I also learned more about String manipulation and the StringBuilder class while trying to format the outputs. I took advantage of the monospace font in the Java console to "mark" vowel sounds!</p>

    <h3>Website building</h3>
    <p>Two years later, in 2022, I coded this website in HTML + CSS. This is actually my first website attempt! I just taught myself via Youtube and other free means this summer. It was a really great learning experience, and I also had a blast with the graphic design. It's also cool to now be able to share my Latin project with people who have no idea what Latin dactylic hexameter is.</p>
    <p>This was coded completely from scratch, except for the vertical dot navigation bar; for the nav bar, I implemented <a href="https://github.com/Superhands89/EasyScrollDots">this open source Github project.</a> The program is an <a href ="https://replit.com/@SydneyLiu/Scansion-of-Latin-Dactylic-Hexameter-with-Manual-Adjustment">embedded repl.it</a> since integrating a Java program into HTML is a big pain.</p>
